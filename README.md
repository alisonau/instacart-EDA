# instacart-EDA
Final Project for MSDS 430 Python for Data Science

<b>Background:</b> Instacart, an online grocery store, publicly released a sample of over 3MM orders from more than 200K users in 2017. For each user, between 4 and 100 of their orders are provided. This was intended for a past competition to predict which products a consumer will purchase again.

<b>Project Objective:</b> This is an EDA analysis to answer:

<b>Primary goal:</b> How do the most frequent customers behave compared to less regular customers, e.g. what products do they buy, how often, etc.? This can help guide strategy and marketing tactics to get people to become more regular customers

<b>Potential secondary questions:</b>
- What is the customer distribution by order volume?
- How frequently do people put in an order (once a week, once a month)?
- What days of the week and time of day do people order most often?
- How many products do people order at a time?
- What products are the best sellers?
- What products are reordered most?
